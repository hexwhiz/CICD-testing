# CICD-Testing

This repository contains a small calculator demo built with Vite + React. The primary purpose of this project is to act as a simple test app for automatic deployments to a Linux server using GitHub Actions.

The calculator is intentionally minimal and used only to verify CI/CD behavior (build, copy artifacts, reload web server).
